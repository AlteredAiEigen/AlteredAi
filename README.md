# AlteredAi

- we provide apis to get data directly in form of numpy array and Tensors (pytorch & tensorflow), which can be feeded directly to Algorithms for training.
- No need to store data locally for pre-processing.
- Preprocessing can be done directly on these provided Tensors with AlteredAi or Torch or Tensorflow.
- ML code written with  AlteredAi can be converted to any framework. We are building on top of ivy.

## install
``` pip install git+https://github.com/AlteredAiEigen/AlteredAi.git ```

- Tutorials will be added soon.
